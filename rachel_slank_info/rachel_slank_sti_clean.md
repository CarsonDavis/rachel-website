## Education

### Ph.D. in Space and Planetary Science
**University of Arkansas**
- **Research Focus:** Behavior of martian salts and their implications for liquid water and habitability
- **Dissertation Approach:** Three integrated methodologies:
  1. **Experimental Studies:** Mars simulation chamber investigation of calcium perchlorate deliquescence in martian regolith analogs
  2. **Field Studies:** Eight-month analog study in the Atacama Desert examining real-time deliquescence and efflorescence cycles of various salts
  3. **Modeling:** Geochemical modeling of ternary salt systems to determine eutonic and deliquescence relative humidities across calcium- and magnesium-based mixtures

### M.S. in Geological Science
**University of Texas at El Paso**
- **Research:** Used thermal inertia data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to identify potential subsurface cavities and lava tubes on the Moon

### B.S. in Geology
**University of Arkansas**

## Professional Experience

### Postdoctoral Fellow
**Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI/USRA)**
- **Project:** Multidisciplinary investigation of an ancient Mars analog in the Colorado Plateau
- **Research Focus:** Study of mafic dike swarm intrusion into iron-rich sediments that may have created hydrothermal environments conducive to habitability
- **Methods:** 
  - Bulk mineralogy analysis (VNIR and XRD)
  - Petrographic analysis
  - Characterization of alteration processes
  - Comparison with martian rover and orbital data

### Current Role
