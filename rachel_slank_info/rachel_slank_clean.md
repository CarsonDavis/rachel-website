## Background

Dr. Rachel Slank is a new postdoctoral fellow at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI). She received her Ph.D. in Space and Planetary Science from the University of Arkansas.

## Research Interests

Dr. Slank holds a variety of research interests, including:
- Deliquescence and the stability of brines
- The water cycle on Mars
- Volcanism
- Planetary geology

## Current Projects at LPI

During her time at the LPI, Dr. Slank is working on two main projects:

### 1. Colorado Plateau Field Analog Study
A chemical and mineralogical investigation of the igneous intrusions and metamorphosed sediments found in the San Rafael Swell on the Colorado Plateau. These numerous dikes, which intruded sulfur-rich sediments, may be an ideal Earth analog field site to Mars and may help active and future missions place constraints on potential habitability of igneous intrusions.

### 2. Martian Surface Deliquescence Modeling
Modeling constraints of deliquescence on the martian surface. The model will consider a variety of factors including mixed salt types and an ice layer to help determine how long a brine can be stable on the surface of Mars.

## Personal Journey

### Early Interest in Space
Rachel's interest in planetary science began in preschool during "space month" in April. After making paper astronaut helmets, hunting for "Moon rocks," and taking a field trip to the Neil Armstrong Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio, she was inspired by Neil Armstrong and decided she wanted to be an astronaut. She spent her free time learning about space, planets, and past astronauts.

### Combining Geology and Space
A few years later, Rachel developed an interest in rocks and geology. When she learned she could combine being an astronaut with studying rocks on other planets, she knew that was her calling for life.

## Mentors and Influences

Rachel credits many people for her success:
- Teachers who encouraged her passion for space science
- Professors who taught her scientific fundamentals and supported her applications
- Mentors like **Dr. Edgard Rivera-Valent√≠n** and **Dr. Gail Arnold** who helped with both science and communication skills
- Friends and her partner Austin who supported her through graduate school
- Her parents who took her stargazing, rock hunting, sent her to space camp, and attended space-related events

## Research Focus

Rachel's main research focus is **water and potential habitability on Mars**, which includes:
- Salts on Mars
- Analyzing Earth locations similar to ancient Mars
- Understanding the martian water cycle
- Lava tubes and their potential as safe havens for astronauts on the Moon or Mars

As she puts it: "I like rocks, and whether they are on Earth or other planetary bodies, I will happily study them!"

## Future Aspirations

### Next 10 Years
Rachel is most excited about the **Artemis Program** and humanity's return to the Moon as the next step in human exploration.

### Dream Research Trip
Rachel's dream research trip is a toss-up between:
1. **Studying rocks on the surface of Mars** - combining her lifelong dream since age 4 with her research focus
2. **Exploring a subsurface lava tube on the Moon** - combining her love of caving with exploring a place no one has ever seen

## Personal Life

### Family
- Married to **Austin**
- Two dogs: **Geo** and **Mya**

### Hobbies
Rachel loves crafting as a stress reliever and practices many forms:
- Knitting (she knits cardigans with pockets!)
- Jewelry making
- Resin work
- Scrapbooking
- Woodworking
- Stained glass
- Cross-stitching

She challenges herself to learn two new crafting styles or improved techniques every year.

## Notable Achievements

- Gave a keynote talk at the Green Bank Observatory for the InSight Mars lander landing
- Was present in the room to witness the detection of InSight's landing, even before NASA heard back from the lander
- Uses the Ares Mars simulation chamber at the University of Arkansas to simulate Mars-like conditions for her research
